= Pro Git, Second Edition, Arabic Edition

This is the **work-in-progress** Arabic translation of the second edition of the Pro Git book.

You can read it online at: https://www.noureddin.dev/progit2/

This branch is currently **dynamic**; it's rebased on the latest English branch. Please open an issue if you have a suggestion.

The original authors moved from Markdown to the amazing AsciiDoc format for the text of the book; here's an https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/syntax-quick-reference/[AsciiDoc quick reference].

== How To Generate the Book

To build the book, you need Ruby, Perl, Bash, and Make.

Run this to install the original book's building requirements:

----
$ bundle install
----

Then you should be able to build it using:

----
$ make
----

Then point your browser to `dist/index.html`, or run a local server there (eg, `cd dist; python3 -m http.server 1122`).

See Also: link:TRANSLATION_NOTES.asc[Translation Notes] for the custom editor and various notes.

Hint: You might like the debugging build instead of the production build; switch to it by:

----
$ make switch_debug
$ make
----

And switch to the production build by:

----
$ make switch_production
$ make
----
